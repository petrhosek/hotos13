\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a new type of application virtual
machine combining SFI with microkernel-style service oriented
archicture providing full POSIX interface.

The solution based on Native Client would allow executing native POSIX
compliant code at near native speed while providing the same security
and isolation guarantees as existing hypervisors. This will allow
the use of wide range of existing legacy software without the overhead
of running (and managing) the entire operating system.

Furthermore, our approach gives greater control than traditional
language runtimes which is so important in cloud deployments.
