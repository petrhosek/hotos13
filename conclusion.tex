\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a new type of application virtual
machine combining SFI with microkernel-style service oriented archicture
providing the POSIX interfaces. The implementation based on Native
Client would allow executing native POSIX compliant code at near native
speed while providing the same security and isolation guarantees as
existing hypervisors. This will allow the use of wide range of existing
legacy software without the overhead of running (and managing) the
entire operating system. Furthermore, our approach gives greater control
than traditional language runtimes which can be useful in a number of
scenarios, in particular as a new type of PaaS native platform.
