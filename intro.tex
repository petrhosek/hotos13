\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%With the rising popularity of cloud computing, the popularity of
%virtualization is steadily growing as a way to implement
%\emph{multi-tenancy}.

%In recent years, virtualization has become crucialy important for \ldots
%multi-tenancy, cloud computing.

Virtualization, in its many forms, seems to have become the universal
solution to a number of problems including security and portability.
With the rising popularity of cloud computing, virtualization has also
become crucially important as a way to ensure \emph{multi-tenant
security}. The XaaS applications can run either on top of virtual
machine monitor where the customer is provided with the entire operating
system (\eg Google Compute Engine) or on top of existing language
runtime (\eg Google App Engine).

While the operating system-level virtualization is desirable in cases
when we require a control over the entire execution stack, it can be
simply too cumbersome when we need to execute only a single application.
A typical OS installation may require storage space in the order of GB
plus additional CPU and memory overhead for running the kernel and
system services. Furthermore, the guest OS requires a frequent
maintenance (\eg installing updates, managing configuration). Language
runtimes on the other hand, while being more lightweight, only target a
single high-level language. 

In this position paper, we argue for an application virtual machine (VM)
capable of running existing POSIX-based applications. The main goal of
our approach is to provide the same security and isolation assurances as
hardware-based hypervisors (\eg Xen or KVM), but implemented entirely in
the user space on top of existing monolithic kernel resembling language
runtimes (\eg JVM).

\todo{Possibly provide a real-world example to motivate the argument.}

%With the rising popularity of cloud computing, virtualization has become
%crucially important as a way to provide \emph{multi-tenancy}. While the
%\emph{Infrastructure as a Service} (IaaS) model assumes provisioning an
%entire operating system using virtual machine monitors (\eg Google
%Compute Engine), the \emph{Platform as a Service} (PaaS) model typically
%relies on a language runtimes (\eg Google App Engine). The~advantage of
%the former is a finer degree of control over the entire application
%stack while the latter allows for better resource utilization. A~modern
%hypervisor uses hardware virtualization technology to enforce isolation
%and resource allocation; in case of language runtimes, ad-hoc sandboxing
%mechanisms are typically being used to provide the same guarantees,
%which results in a limited number of supported platforms (\eg Java,
%Python and Go in case of Google App Engine).

%As cloud providers can use multi-tenancy run large number of
%applications---potentially coming from different customers---under a
%single operating system instance. The existing PaaS platforms such as
%Google App Engine already uses multi-tenancy where several applications
%share the same physical or virtual machine.  However, to ensure the
%security and isolation, the number of supported platforms is limited to
%Java, Python and Go using custom sandboxed runtimes.

%The existing PaaS platforms such as Google App Engine already uses
%multi-tenancy where several applications share the same physical or
%virtual machine.  However, to ensure the security and isolation, the
%number of supported platforms is limited to Java, Python and Go using
%custom sandboxed runtimes.

Such an execution environment could form the basis for a new kind of
POSIX compliant PaaS native platform, which will allow for execution of
high-performance applications. Such a platform will be more efficient
than traditional virtualization and some language based sandboxes while
more flexible than Linux-based systems, akin to virtual machines.
Furthermore, native code support will enable the use of existing C/C++
libraries and legacy code as well as extended instruction sets (\eg SSE
or AVX) for high-performance applications. An example of such a service
is Google Exacycle\footnote{See
\url{http://research.google.com/university/exacycle_program.html} and
\url{http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2011/04/1-billion-core-hours-of-computational.html}.},
which provides a PaaS platform for large-scale, embarrasingly parallel
batch computations.

%Furthermore, native code support together with full POSIX interface
%allows running existing runtimes on top of our execution environment
%without the necessity of an ad-hoc sandboxing mechanism since the
%environment itself already provides sandboxing capabilities. This has a
%number of advantages.  First, it is possible to use ``vanilla'' language
%runtimes which allows for upgrading to a newer version immediately after
%they are released significantly reducing the risk of zero-day
%vulnerabilities. Second, it allows provisioning of wider range of
%runtimes potentially attracting more customers, even those using less
%popular languages and platforms.  Third, it will allow use of native
%extensions supported by most language runtimes, but not always available in
%PaaS environments for security reasons.

%The solution based on Native Client would allow executing native
%POSIX-compliant code at near native speed while providing the same
%security and isolation guarantees. This will allow the use of wide
%range of existing legacy software without the overhead of running (and
%managing) the entire VM.

%i like NaCl as a posix-like platform-as-a-service a little better,
%though restricting to the posix-y subset sort of works wrt running on a
%real posix-y OS too, i guess.

%not just novelty, but TCB minimization

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:overview} gives an overview of our approach, \ldots.
Then, Section~\ref{sec:prototype} presents \ldots. Finally,
Section~\ref{sec:related} discusses related work and
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

%Furthermore, our approach gives greater level control which is so
%important in cloud deployments.

%In recent years, we have witnessed a boom of virtualization. Most of the
%server infrastructure which is now being used runs virtualized.
%However, virtualization still failed to attract desktop market despite
%obvious advantages such as portability, security, reliability and
%isolation. We believe this is because the existing virtualization
%solutions are too heavyweight and cumbersome. They require the user run
%an entire operating system which is suitable for infrastructure
%provisioning in data centers as well as certain cloud applications, but
%is simply too cumbersome for desktop and client applications.

%In this paper, we propose a more lightweight alternative. Instead of
%running the full operating system, our goal is to combine aspects of
%microkernel and monolithic kernel design with software fault isolation
%techniques to provide lightweight solution for virtualization of
%existing applications in the user space. Furthemore, our proposed
%approach allows applications to be run on top of three major operating
%system without recompilation.
