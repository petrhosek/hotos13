In recent years, we have witnessed a boom of virtualization. Most of the
servier infrastructure which is now being used is running virtualized.
However, virtualization still failed to attract desktop market despite
obvious advantages such as portability, security, reliability and
isolation. We believe this is because the existing virtualization
solutions are too heavyweight and cumbersome. They allow to run entire
operating system which is suitable for infrastructure provisioning in
data center and cloud applications, but is simply too cumbersome for
desktop and client applications.

In this paper, we propose more lightweight alternative. Instead of
running full operating system kernel, our goal is to combine
micro-kernel design with software fault isolation techniques to provide
lightweight solution for virtualization of existing applications in the
user space.  Furthemore, our proposed approach allows applications to be
run on top of three major operating system without recompilation.
