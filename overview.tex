Native Client, commonly abbreviated ``NaCl'' when used as an adjective,
is an open-source production-quality SFI-based sandbox for the safe
execution of untrusted, multi-threaded user-level machine
code~\cite{yee:ieee-sp09,sehr:usenix-sec10,ansel:pldi11}. While
primarily aimed towards executing native compiled code inside the web
browser, the NaCl core components can be also used as a
general-purpose sandbox.

The NaCl architecture, depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:architecture},
comprises of many different components resembling different components
of an operating system. The component which fulfills the role of kernel
is the \emph{service runtime}.
% largely resembles existing monolithic and micro-kernel design.
The service runtime is a native executable which provides resource
abstractions to isolate NaCl applications from host resources and
underlying operating system interfaces. Even though it shares a process
with the contained NaCl module, the service runtime prevents untrusted
code from inappropriate accesses using a combination of various
techniques which differ for various target
architectures~\cite{yee:ieee-sp09,sehr:usenix-sec10}. The service
runtime trusted code and data are only accessible through a controlled
interface.

While NaCl already resembles existing monolithic and micro-kernel
designs providing facilities such as multi-threading and virtual memory
management, it lacks two important features, process management and
shared memory. \todo{Not sure whether shared memory really that
important?}

\todo{Explain how the NaCl architecture compares with on-the-metal
  micro-kernel designs, viz: Native Client is on top of an existing
  monolithic kernel, so the various microkernel-related overheads
  (context switch, etc) still exist.  The benefits are structural:
  easier replacement of components/modules, easier security audits.}

\subsection{Process Support}
\label{sub:process_support}

While existing NaCl implementation already provides thread support,
exposed through a subset of the POSIX threads interface, it is missing
process management support. The process support is necessary in cases
when resource sharing, in particular of virtual memory, is not desired.

The process support is important for certain set of applications such
as interactive shells. These shells typically rely on \textstt{fork} to
spawn new application processes. 

\todo{This introduction is not particularly amazing.}

The NaCl Application Binary Interface (ABI) exposed to untrusted code is
modeled after POSIX ABI. This makes it easy to port existing POSIX
application over to NaCl with minimal or no changes at all.
% Service runtime provides a subset of the POSIX threads interface as
% well as common POSIX Ô¨Åle I/O interface.

Therefore, following the same philosophy, our main goal when designing
the process support for NaCl was to provide an equivalent of the POSIX
\textstt{fork} system call. However, there are two challenges.

First, the process support has to be portable. Native Client executable
can be run on any supported platform without recompilation (as long as
the architecture remains the same). This means that process support can
only rely on a common denominator of the functionality provided by the
supported underlying operating systems (\ie Windows, Linux and OS X).

Different operating systems provide different process creation
primitives. For example, while operating systems from the UNIX family
typically use the \textstt{fork} semantics, Windows family operating
systems provide \textstt{spawn} facilities. Even though POSIX
specification provides both \textstt{fork} and \textstt{posix\_spawn},
only OS X as fully POSIX conformant provides both primitives.

Second, the process support needs to have a clear semantics. This is an
issue with \textstt{fork} operation which is supposed to create the
exact copy the existing process. However, when using a \textstt{fork}
with multi-threaded program, we might end up in an inconsistent state
since only the thread invoking \textstt{fork} is cloned.

This problem is even worse in case of NaCl service runtime which shares
the process with untrusted code and uses automatic resource management
to increase reliability of resource (de)allocation. However, if we use
the \textstt{fork} system call to create a copy of the existing process,
the bookkeeping information will become invalid (\eg memory mappings,
descriptors, locks) leading to potentially inconsistent state.

To address these challenges, instead of providing the
\textstt{fork}-like facility, we have decided to provide set of basic
primitives which can be used to construct the new process in truly
micro-kernel fashion, and rely on untrusted libraries to implement the
\textstt{fork}-like semantics (\eg or different semantics if needed) on
top of these.

\ldots

Since parent process is responsible for setting up the reverse service
connection, it can subsume the role of reverse service itself and either
proxy some of the root reverse service operations or completely replace
it.

\ldots

Since reverse service is being used for accessing file system \ldots we
can effectively create a sub-sandbox for the child process. one example
computational kernel (seccomp).

\subsection{Memory Sharing}
\label{sub:memory_sharing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Memory Service used for fork emulation;
\item Page protection and user-level exceptions used to detect
  writes to shared pages to emulate copy-on-write;
\item Assumes same protection domain, so badly behaving application
  can only harm themselves.
\end{itemize}

User-level fork emulation library manages address space.  All memory
are backed by shared memory, though initially not necessarily actually
shared.  On fork, new subprocess is created which have special IRT
that speaks the fork-emulation protocol.  The subprocess receives
shared memory descriptors and location where they are mapped in the
parent process.  Both parent and child processes change page
protection of all pages to read-only to emulate copy-on-write.  On
fault, affected page is copied to new shared memory, reference count
to the old page within the original shared memory object is
decremented, the new shared memory pages mapped in place with writable
mapping, and the affect thread is continued.  We don't want to have a
separate shared memory file for every 64KB page (probably too many
descriptors, filesystem related overhead), so there will be some
interesting optimizations here: if we shared memory object is multiple
pages in size, but a ``hole'' in the middle has zero references, how
do we reclaim the disk / paging space?

Concerns: shared memory is a scarce resource.  /dev/shm is typically a
small fraction of RAM size.  Threads vs fork -- may need to stop all
other threads while pages are being manipulated?  On Unices where mmap
on top of existing mapping is atomic, it may not be necessary; on
Windows where unmap must occur first and therefore overmapping is not
atomic, this is likely to be necessary.
