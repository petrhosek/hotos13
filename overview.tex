Native Client, commonly abbreviated ``NaCl'' when used as an adjective,
is an open-source production-quality SFI-based sandbox for the safe
execution of untrusted, multi-threaded user-level machine
code~\cite{yee:ieee-sp09,sehr:usenix-sec10,ansel:pldi11}. While
primarily aimed towards executing native compiled code inside the web
browser, the NaCl core components can be also used as
general-purpose sandbox.

NaCl architecture, depicted in Figure \ldots largely resemebles
existing monolithic- and micro-kernel design.
